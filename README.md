# Relationship Drag-N-Drop Game Web App

## Project info

**Description**
This is a custom interactive web app created to celebrate a relationship milestone. It features a landing page and three unique experiences: a drag-and-drop memory game that challenges the user to recall monthly anniversary activities in order, a hover-based memory carousel with short descriptions, and a digital love letter. The project blends playful interaction with personal storytelling to create a heartfelt, web-based experience. Designed to showcase both creativity and front-end development skills.
